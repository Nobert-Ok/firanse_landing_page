          in connection with this contract, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination,

        <p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Parties agree that any
          arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by
          law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any
          Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no

          piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision
          is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within
          that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
          court of competent</p>
        <p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">jurisdiction within the courts
          listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
