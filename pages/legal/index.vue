            <p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Most web browsers and some mobile operating
              systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can
              activate
              to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and
              collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
              been
              finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
              automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
              adopted
              that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
              privacy
